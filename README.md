## 🛒 Cart Logic

- Dishes are stored in a JavaScript array with `id`, `name`, `price`, `category`, `icon`, `badge`
- `addToCart()` increments quantity if item already exists
- `updateQty()` handles + / − buttons; removes item at 0
- Cart syncs to `localStorage` on every update
- Total calculated dynamically in Indian Rupees (₹)
